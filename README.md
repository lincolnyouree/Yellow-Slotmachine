# User Experience

## User Persona #1:

Paul is an aging singer-songwriter who enjoys cartoons, LSD, and the occasional trip down Penny, rather, memory lane. Paul has an upcoming show at a rundown casino in Cripple Creek and knows he will have some time to kill after his set. 

## User Persona #2:

Ringo is a drummer and aspiring singer. He likely needs the money.

## Minimum Viable Product:
* As a user, I should be able to click on a button to simulate a spin. 
* As a user, I should be able to keep a running total of my money. 
* As a user, I should be paid the correct amount when I win a spin.
* As a user, I should see a message after each spin indicating whether I have won, lost, or can spin again. 
* As a user, I should see confetti and a winning message when I win a spin.  

## Stretch Goals:
* Increase and decrease bet amount.
* Allow user to choose theme.
* Spinning reels.
* Time out function to make slots appear in sequential order.
* Asynchronous timer to make slots appear at different increments.
* Mobile responsiveness.
